## What is an artifact? 

In Databricks, an artifact refers to a file or a collection of files associated with a project or data analysis workflow. These artifacts can include code, notebooks, libraries, data files, or other relevant resources stored in the Databricks File System (DBFS). Artifacts help organize and share resources, ensuring consistency and reproducibility. Databricks provides tools like the Workspace and CLI to manage artifacts effectively, streamlining data workflows and promoting collaboration.

## Mlflow and Artifact
MLflow and artifacts are closely related in the context of Databricks.

MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. It provides tools and APIs for tracking experiments, packaging and deploying models, and managing model versions. MLflow is often used in conjunction with Databricks to facilitate reproducible and scalable machine learning workflows.

One of the key components of MLflow is the artifact store. The artifact store is a central location where MLflow stores the artifacts associated with each run of an experiment. These artifacts can include model files, data files, configuration files, and any other resources that are relevant to the experiment.

Databricks provides integration with MLflow, allowing you to leverage the power of MLflow for managing and tracking machine learning experiments within the Databricks environment. When you use MLflow with Databricks, the artifacts generated during training or evaluation of machine learning models are automatically stored in the Databricks File System (DBFS) as part of the MLflow experiment run.

This integration enables seamless tracking and management of artifacts alongside the MLflow experiment data. You can easily access, version, and compare artifacts associated with different runs of an experiment using the MLflow UI or APIs. This combination of MLflow and Databricks helps to streamline the machine learning workflow, enhance collaboration, and ensure reproducibility by capturing and managing all the necessary artifacts and experiment metadata in one place.

## Databricks Workspace

It is a web-based interface that allows you to manage and organize your Databricks resources, including notebooks, libraries, jobs, clusters, and data.
## MLflow

```import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import mlflow

# Load and plot the image

image_path = "path/to/image.jpg"
image = plt.imread(image_path)
plt.imshow(image)
plt.axis("off")

# Log the image as an artifact in MLflow

with mlflow.start_run():
    mlflow.log_artifact(image_path, artifact_path="images")
