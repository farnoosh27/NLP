# MLOps
MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is a set of practices and techniques that aims to operationalize and manage machine learning models throughout their lifecycle. It combines principles from machine learning, software engineering, and DevOps to streamline the deployment, monitoring, and management of machine learning systems in production environments.

MLOps addresses the challenges associated with deploying and maintaining machine learning models at scale, ensuring their reliability, scalability, and performance. It focuses on integrating the development, training, and deployment of models with the existing software development and operations processes.

## MLOps include:

* Model Development: MLOps involves collaborative development practices for machine learning models, including version control, code reviews, and testing to ensure reproducibility and maintainability.

* Model Training: It encompasses techniques for efficiently training and validating models using large datasets, distributed computing, and automated hyperparameter tuning.

* Model Deployment: MLOps provides frameworks and tools for deploying models into production environments, making them available for inference or predictions. This involves containerization, orchestration, and deployment strategies to ensure scalability and availability.

* Monitoring and Logging: Continuous monitoring of deployed models helps detect anomalies, track performance, and ensure data quality. Logging and tracking relevant metrics provide insights for model improvement and debugging.

* Infrastructure Management: MLOps involves managing the infrastructure required to deploy and run machine learning models, including cloud resources, containers, and data pipelines.

* Automation and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): MLOps leverages automation to streamline the integration and deployment of models, enabling continuous delivery and reducing manual overhead.

By implementing MLOps practices, organizations can effectively manage the entire lifecycle of machine learning models, from development to deployment and maintenance. This helps ensure the reliability, scalability, and reproducibility of models, facilitating their successful integration into production systems.

## MLflow
is an open-source platform designed to help manage the machine learning (ML) lifecycle. It provides tools and components to streamline the development, experimentation, deployment, and monitoring of machine learning models. MLflow was developed by Databricks, a company founded by the creators of Apache Spark.
