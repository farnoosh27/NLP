## LLMs
A large language model (LLM) is a computer-based model that uses an artificial neural network with numerous parameters to process language. It is trained on vast amounts of unlabeled text, containing billions or even trillions of tokens, using self-supervised or semi-supervised learning methods. LLMs became prominent in 2018 with the development of transformers, which allowed for faster training compared to previous models like long short-term memory (LSTM). This advancement enabled the use of large language datasets such as the Wikipedia Corpus and Common Crawl, thanks to parallelization techniques. LLMs are versatile models capable of performing well in a wide range of tasks. The effectiveness of language models in various tasks depends more on the size of the training corpus, the number of parameters, and the computational power achieved through parallel computing than on the model's design. Consequently, natural language processing research has shifted away from training specialized supervised models for specific tasks.
