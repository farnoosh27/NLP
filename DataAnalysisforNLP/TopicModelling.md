Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA): LDA is a popular probabilistic model that assumes documents are a mixture of topics, and topics are distributions over words. It is widely used for discovering topics in a text corpus and assigning topic probabilities to each document.

Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF): NMF is a matrix factorization technique that decomposes a document-term matrix into topic and weight matrices. It is known for its interpretability and has been widely applied in topic modeling tasks.

Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA): pLSA is a generative probabilistic model that represents documents as mixtures of topics. It calculates the probability of a word occurring given a particular topic. pLSA can estimate the underlying topic structure for topic modeling.

Word Embedding-based Approaches: Word embedding models like Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT can be used for topic modeling. These models represent words as dense vectors in a continuous space, capturing semantic relationships. Clustering words based on their vector representations helps identify groups representing different topics.

Topic Coherence Measures: Topic coherence measures are used to evaluate and refine topic modeling results. They assess the semantic coherence of words within each topic, providing a quantitative metric for topic quality. Coherence measures help in determining the optimal number of topics or comparing different topic modeling techniques.
