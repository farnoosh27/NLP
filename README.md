# NLP, MLOps and Telecommunication 

I am trying to specialize in Natural Language Processing for the purpose of my job, so here is the repository! 
The core concepts are as follows:  

* Tokenization: The process of breaking down a text or sentence into smaller units, called tokens. Tokens can be words, phrases, or even individual characters, depending on the level of granularity required.

* Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: Assigning grammatical tags to each word in a sentence, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. POS tagging helps in understanding the syntactic structure of a sentence.

* Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying named entities in text, such as person names, locations, organizations, dates, etc. NER is used to extract structured information from unstructured text.

* Lemmatization and Stemming: Reducing words to their base or root form. Lemmatization takes into account the morphological analysis of words, whereas stemming uses heuristic rules to truncate words.

* Stop Word Removal: Eliminating commonly used words (such as "a," "the," "is") that do not contribute much to the overall meaning of a sentence. Stop word removal helps reduce noise in NLP tasks like information retrieval and text classification.

* Sentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment or opinion expressed in a piece of text, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis is useful for tasks like social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and brand reputation management.

* Text Classification: Assigning predefined categories or labels to text documents based on their content. This includes tasks like topic classification, spam detection, sentiment analysis, etc. Machine learning algorithms are often used for text classification.

* Word Embeddings: Representing words or phrases as dense vectors in a continuous vector space. Word embeddings capture semantic relationships between words, allowing algorithms to understand word similarities and analogies.

* Language Models: Statistical models that predict the probability of a word or sequence of words given the context. Language models have become increasingly powerful with the development of deep learning techniques and have enabled significant advancements in tasks like machine translation, text generation, and question answering.

* Machine Translation: The task of automatically translating text from one language to another. Machine translation systems employ various techniques, including statistical methods, rule-based approaches, and neural networks, to achieve accurate translations.

# Telecommunication
* 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project) is a global collaboration of telecommunications standards organizations that develops protocols and specifications for mobile communication networks. It was established in 1998 and is responsible for defining the standards for the technology used in 3G (Third Generation) and beyond mobile networks.

The 3GPP is composed of several partner organizations, including regional telecommunications standards bodies such as the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), the Association of Radio Industries and Businesses (ARIB) in Japan, the Telecommunication Technology Committee (TTC) in Japan, and the China Communications Standards Association (CCSA) in China.

The main objective of 3GPP is to create globally applicable standards for mobile communication systems, ensuring compatibility and interoperability across different networks and devices. These standards cover various aspects of mobile communications, including radio access, core network architecture, protocols, security, and services.

3GPP has played a crucial role in the development of mobile technologies, such as GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System), LTE (Long-Term Evolution), and more recently, 5G (Fifth Generation) networks. It continues to work on advancing mobile communication standards and technologies to meet the evolving needs of the industry and consumers.

# MLops
MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is a set of practices and techniques that aims to operationalize and manage machine learning models throughout their lifecycle. It combines principles from machine learning, software engineering, and DevOps to streamline the deployment, monitoring, and management of machine learning systems in production environments.

MLOps addresses the challenges associated with deploying and maintaining machine learning models at scale, ensuring their reliability, scalability, and performance. It focuses on integrating the development, training, and deployment of models with the existing software development and operations processes.

## MLOps include:

* Model Development: MLOps involves collaborative development practices for machine learning models, including version control, code reviews, and testing to ensure reproducibility and maintainability.

* Model Training: It encompasses techniques for efficiently training and validating models using large datasets, distributed computing, and automated hyperparameter tuning.

* Model Deployment: MLOps provides frameworks and tools for deploying models into production environments, making them available for inference or predictions. This involves containerization, orchestration, and deployment strategies to ensure scalability and availability.

* Monitoring and Logging: Continuous monitoring of deployed models helps detect anomalies, track performance, and ensure data quality. Logging and tracking relevant metrics provide insights for model improvement and debugging.

* Infrastructure Management: MLOps involves managing the infrastructure required to deploy and run machine learning models, including cloud resources, containers, and data pipelines.

* Automation and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): MLOps leverages automation to streamline the integration and deployment of models, enabling continuous delivery and reducing manual overhead.

By implementing MLOps practices, organizations can effectively manage the entire lifecycle of machine learning models, from development to deployment and maintenance. This helps ensure the reliability, scalability, and reproducibility of models, facilitating their successful integration into production systems.

## MLflow
is an open-source platform designed to help manage the machine learning (ML) lifecycle. It provides tools and components to streamline the development, experimentation, deployment, and monitoring of machine learning models. MLflow was developed by Databricks, a company founded by the creators of Apache Spark.



Word Embeddings: Word embeddings are dense vector representations of words in a continuous vector space. They aim to capture semantic and syntactic relationships between words based on their usage in a given corpus. Each word is represented by a high-dimensional vector, and similar words tend to have vectors that are closer together in the vector space. Word embeddings are typically learned from large text corpora using unsupervised learning techniques like Word2Vec, GloVe, or fastText.

Word embeddings have the advantage of capturing the meaning and context of words, allowing algorithms to understand the semantic relationships between words. They are widely used in various NLP tasks such as word similarity, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.

Vectorization: Vectorization, on the other hand, is a more general term that refers to the process of converting any kind of data (including text) into numerical vectors that machine learning algorithms can understand. In the context of NLP, vectorization often refers to representing textual data as numerical feature vectors.

There are different techniques for vectorizing text, and word embeddings are one of them. Other vectorization techniques include:

One-Hot Encoding: Each word is represented as a binary vector where only one element is 1 (indicating the presence of that word) and all other elements are 0.

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): It represents the importance of a word in a document by considering both the frequency of the word in the document (term frequency) and the rarity of the word in the entire corpus (inverse document frequency).

Bag-of-Words (BoW): It represents a document as a vector of word counts, ignoring the word order but considering the frequency of each word in the document.

N-gram Vectors: It represents contiguous sequences of n words as vectors, capturing the local word order and context.

These vectorization techniques transform textual data into numerical representations that can be used as input for machine learning algorithms. Word embeddings, such as Word2Vec or GloVe, are a more advanced form of vectorization that capture semantic relationships between words in a dense vector space.
