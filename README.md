# NLP, MLOps, and Telecommunication 

I am trying to specialize in Natural Language Processing for the purpose of my job, so here is the repository! 
The core concepts are as follows:  

* Tokenization: The process of breaking down a text or sentence into smaller units, called tokens. Tokens can be words, phrases, or even individual characters, depending on the level of granularity required.

* Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: Assigning grammatical tags to each word in a sentence, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. POS tagging helps in understanding the syntactic structure of a sentence.

* Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying named entities in text, such as person names, locations, organizations, dates, etc. NER is used to extract structured information from unstructured text.

* Lemmatization and Stemming: Reducing words to their base or root form. Lemmatization takes into account the morphological analysis of words, whereas stemming uses heuristic rules to truncate words.

* Stop Word Removal: Eliminating commonly used words (such as "a," "the," "is") that do not contribute much to the overall meaning of a sentence. Stop word removal helps reduce noise in NLP tasks like information retrieval and text classification.

* Sentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment or opinion expressed in a piece of text, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis is useful for tasks like social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and brand reputation management.

* Text Classification: Assigning predefined categories or labels to text documents based on their content. This includes tasks like topic classification, spam detection, sentiment analysis, etc. Machine learning algorithms are often used for text classification.

* Word Embeddings: Representing words or phrases as dense vectors in a continuous vector space. Word embeddings capture semantic relationships between words, allowing algorithms to understand word similarities and analogies.

* Language Models: Statistical models that predict the probability of a word or sequence of words given the context. Language models have become increasingly powerful with the development of deep learning techniques and have enabled significant advancements in tasks like machine translation, text generation, and question answering.

* Machine Translation: The task of automatically translating text from one language to another. Machine translation systems employ various techniques, including statistical methods, rule-based approaches, and neural networks, to achieve accurate translations.
