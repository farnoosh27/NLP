## Wireshark

Wireshark is an open-source network protocol analyzer widely used for network troubleshooting, analysis, and packet inspection. It allows users to capture and analyze network traffic in real-time or analyze captured packet data offline. Wireshark supports various network protocols, including Ethernet, TCP/IP, UDP, HTTP, DNS, and many others.

With Wireshark, you can capture packets on your network interface and examine the contents of each packet, including the headers, payloads, and various protocol-specific details. This can be useful for diagnosing network issues, detecting malicious activity, understanding communication patterns, and optimizing network performance.

Wireshark provides a user-friendly interface that displays captured packets in a readable format, allowing you to apply filters, search for specific criteria, and perform advanced analysis. It also offers features like packet coloring, statistics generation, protocol decoding, and the ability to export captured data for further analysis.

Keep in mind that using Wireshark may require technical knowledge and understanding of networking protocols. Additionally, it's important to respect privacy and legal considerations when capturing and analyzing network traffic, ensuring that you have appropriate authorization to monitor the network.


## Tshark

Tshark is a command-line tool that comes bundled with Wireshark. It offers similar functionality as Wireshark but without the graphical user interface (GUI). Tshark is useful for automated or script-based packet analysis.
