## Package:

A package in Python is a way of organizing related modules (Python files) into a single directory to create a cohesive and reusable set of functionalities.
A package can contain multiple sub-packages and modules, forming a hierarchical structure.
The presence of a special file called __init__.py in a directory indicates that the directory is a Python package.
Packages help in organizing code, avoiding naming conflicts, and promoting modularity and code reusability.
## Library:

In Python, a library refers to a collection of pre-written functions and modules that can be imported and used in your code.
Libraries provide ready-to-use functionality to perform specific tasks, such as handling dates, working with files, accessing databases, performing mathematical calculations, etc.
Examples of Python libraries include datetime for date and time operations, requests for making HTTP requests, pandas for data manipulation and analysis, and matplotlib for data visualization.
## Framework:

A framework in Python is a higher-level structure or platform that provides a foundation and set of tools for building applications.
Unlike libraries that you import into your code, a framework provides a structured environment where you write your code following a specific architecture or design pattern dictated by the framework.
Frameworks often dictate the flow of control and provide functionalities, modules, and APIs to solve common problems, allowing developers to focus on application-specific logic.
Examples of Python frameworks include Django and Flask for web development, TensorFlow and PyTorch for machine learning, and PyQt and Tkinter for building graphical user interfaces.
