PEP 8 stands for "Python Enhancement Proposal 8." It is a style guide for writing clean, readable, and maintainable Python code. PEP 8 provides guidelines on various aspects of coding style, including naming conventions, indentation, whitespace, comments, and more. The goal of PEP 8 is to promote consistency across Python codebases, making it easier for developers to collaborate and maintain code over time.

PEP 8 covers a wide range of coding style recommendations, some of which include:

Indentation: Use 4 spaces per indentation level and avoid using tabs.

Whitespace in Expressions and Statements: Use a single space around operators and after commas. Avoid extraneous whitespace within parentheses, brackets, or braces.

Imports: Imports should be on separate lines, and each import should be listed individually.

Naming Conventions:

Use lowercase with underscores for variable and function names (e.g., my_variable, my_function).
Use CamelCase for class names (e.g., MyClass).
Use UPPERCASE for constants (e.g., MY_CONSTANT).
Comments and Documentation:

Use docstrings to document modules, classes, functions, and methods.
Write clear and concise comments that explain the intent behind the code.
Maximum Line Length: Limit lines to 79 characters for code and 72 characters for docstrings and comments.

Whitespace Between Functions and Classes: Use two blank lines between top-level functions and classes.

Conditional Expressions: Use a space on both sides of a binary operator in conditional expressions (if, while, etc.).

Error Prone Cases: Avoid using wildcard imports (from module import *) and single-character variable names, except for counters and iterators (i, j, etc.).

PEP 8 is widely adopted within the Python community and is considered the standard for Python coding style. Adhering to PEP 8 guidelines helps improve code readability and maintainability, especially when multiple developers are working on the same project. There are tools available, such as linters and code formatters, that can automatically check and format your code according to PEP 8 guidelines.
