Continuous Delivery (CD) is similar to CD, but with the distinction that in Continuous Delivery, code changes are automatically deployed to a staging environment after passing CI, and the deployment to the production environment is typically triggered manually, allowing for human verification and approval before going live.

## pyproject.toml vs setup.py 

Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) 518, which describes a mechanism for specifying minimum and maximum version requirements for Python packages. PEP 518 introduces the use of a new file called pyproject.toml for specifying build system requirements and build backend configuration.
