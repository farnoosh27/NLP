## What is CI/CD?

Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of regularly integrating code changes into a shared repository, triggering automated build processes and tests to detect issues early in the development process.

Continuous Delivery (CD) is similar to CD, but with the distinction that in Continuous Delivery, code changes are automatically deployed to a staging environment after passing CI, and the deployment to the production environment is typically triggered manually, allowing for human verification and approval before going live.

## What are package managers?
probably a useful article can be found here: https://www.activestate.com/blog/which-python-dependency-manager-should-i-choose/

### PIP
## pyproject.toml vs setup.py 

Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) 518, which describes a mechanism for specifying minimum and maximum version requirements for Python packages. PEP 518 introduces the use of a new file called pyproject.toml for specifying build system requirements and build backend configuration.
