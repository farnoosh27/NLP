## Steps towards packaging
Install Hatch: Using pip, you install Hatch with pip install hatch.

Create a New Hatch Project: Use hatch new my_package to create a new project with the necessary structure.

Specify Package Metadata: Edit the pyproject.toml file to add your package's metadata (e.g., name, version, license, authors).

Add Dependencies: Specify your package's dependencies in the pyproject.toml file under the [tool.hatch.dependencies] section.

Build the Package: Use hatch wheel to build your package, which creates a .whl file in the dist/ directory.

Publish the Package: Publish your package to PyPI using hatch release. You'll need to authenticate with your PyPI account.

Install Your Package: Once published, your package is available for installation via pip install my_package.
