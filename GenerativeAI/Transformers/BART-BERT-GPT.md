BERT (Bidirectional Encoder)
Type: Encoder
Description: BERT is primarily an encoder model. It's trained on a masked language modeling task where it learns to predict masked words within sentences, considering the bidirectional context of the input text. BERT captures rich contextual representations of words.
GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
Type: Decoder
Description: GPT is a decoder model. It's trained to generate text autoregressively, predicting the next word based on the context of the preceding words. GPT models have been used for various text generation tasks, including language modeling, text completion, text generation, and more.
BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer)
Type: Combination of Encoder and Decoder
Description: BART is a different type of model compared to BERT and GPT. It combines elements of both encoder and decoder models:
Encoder: BART uses a bidirectional encoder similar to BERT, which learns contextual representations of the input text.
Decoder: BART also uses a decoder that can generate text autoregressively, similar to GPT. It's trained on a denoising autoencoder task, where it learns to reconstruct original sentences from noisy or corrupted versions.
BART is versatile and capable of understanding and generating text effectively, making it suitable for various NLP tasks, including text summarization, text generation, and document classification.
