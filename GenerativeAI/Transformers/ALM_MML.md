| Aspect                             | Autoregressive Language Modeling (ALM) | Masked Language Modeling (MLM)   |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Objective**                      | Predict the next word in a sequence, based on preceding words. | Predict masked tokens within a sequence by inferring missing information. |
| **Token Replacement**              | No token masking involved.             | Randomly replace a percentage of tokens with "[MASK]" tokens or other random tokens. |
| **Bidirectionality**               | Unidirectional; models operate in either left-to-right or right-to-left fashion. | Bidirectional; models consider context from both left and right sides of the masked token. |
| **Context for Predictions**        | Context limited to preceding words.     | Context includes both preceding and following tokens, allowing for a broader understanding. |
| **Example Models**                 | GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), XLNet. | BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), RoBERTa. |
| **Pre-training Approach**          | Generates text one token at a time.    | Predicts masked tokens, encouraging understanding of contextual relationships. |
| **Strengths**                      | Well-suited for text generation tasks. Captures local context well. | Effective for capturing bidirectional context and understanding broader relationships in text. |
| **Use Cases**                     | Text generation, completion, summarization. | Text understanding, contextual embeddings, sentence representations. |
| **Popular Applications**           | OpenAI's GPT-3 for various language tasks. | BERT for diverse NLP tasks, including text classification and question-answering. |
