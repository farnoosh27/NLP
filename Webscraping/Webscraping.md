Here I would like to write the things I find very helpful for extracting data based on webpages: 
Web scraping is often necessary for several reasons:

Data collection: Web scraping allows you to gather data from websites that do not provide APIs or structured data feeds. It enables you to access and extract data from various sources on the web, including text, images, tables, product details, user reviews, and more.

Market research and competitive analysis: By scraping data from multiple websites, you can gather information about competitors, pricing trends, market dynamics, customer reviews, and other valuable insights to make informed business decisions.

Content aggregation: Web scraping can be used to aggregate and consolidate data from multiple websites into a single location. This is useful for creating news aggregators, comparison websites, job boards, and other platforms that require data from various sources.

Monitoring and tracking: Web scraping allows you to monitor websites for specific changes, such as price fluctuations, stock availability, content updates, or news articles. This can be useful for tracking competitors, monitoring market trends, or staying up-to-date with relevant information.

Research and academic purposes: Researchers and academics often use web scraping to collect data for their studies, analyze social media sentiment, track public opinion, or gather data for statistical analysis.

Machine learning and AI training: Web scraping provides a way to collect large datasets for training machine learning models or building AI systems. It allows you to acquire labeled data, images, text, or other types of data necessary for model training and evaluation.
## Beautiful Soup
Beautiful Soup is a Python library used for web scraping and parsing HTML or XML documents. It provides convenient methods and functionality to extract data from web pages by navigating the HTML structure and locating specific elements based on tags, attributes, or CSS selectors.

With Beautiful Soup, you can parse HTML or XML content and extract the desired information, such as text, links, tables, or specific elements, from the structured document. It handles poorly formatted markup and provides a consistent interface for accessing and manipulating the data.
