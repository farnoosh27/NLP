Here I would like to write the things I find very helpful for extracting data based on webpages: 
Web scraping is often necessary for several reasons:



## Beautiful Soup
Beautiful Soup is a Python library used for web scraping and parsing HTML or XML documents. It provides convenient methods and functionality to extract data from web pages by navigating the HTML structure and locating specific elements based on tags, attributes, or CSS selectors.

With Beautiful Soup, you can parse HTML or XML content and extract the desired information, such as text, links, tables, or specific elements, from the structured document. It handles poorly formatted markup and provides a consistent interface for accessing and manipulating the data.
