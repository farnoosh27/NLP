## what is regular expressions
In Python, regular expressions are supported through the re module, which provides functions for working with regular expressions. The re module allows you to create regular expressions, search for patterns within strings, and perform various operations on text.

## what to do
* It is important to examine the data first to see if any patterns can be recognized so that parsing operations can be optimized.
* when using re, data in a real-world situation can often contain errant characters, and your program must correctly handle these situations.
